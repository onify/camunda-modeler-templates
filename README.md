# Camunda Modeler element templates for Onify

Element templates allow you to create pre-defined configurations for BPMN elements such as service and user tasks. Once applied via the properties panel they provide configured custom inputs to the user. For more information, see https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/desktop-modeler/element-templates/about-templates/.

This repo contains templates customized for Onify. Please feel free to use and/or contribute.
